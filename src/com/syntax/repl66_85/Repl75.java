//For you to do: 
//
//Using the following array. 
//{45, 78, 12,  67, 55, 89, 23, 77, 88}
//Create a for loop to extract values from that array so your output looks as below:
//
//Expected Output:
//78 55 77  
//
//Note: Find out what is the start point an how much you need to increment to get the result.
