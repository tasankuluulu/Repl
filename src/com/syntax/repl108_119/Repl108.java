//For you to do:
//
//1. create method and name as m1. Inside your method body add print statement as "m1 method implementation"
//2. create another method and name as m2. Inside your method body add print statement as "m2 method implementation"
//3. Call these two methods in the main method
//
//Expected Output:
//m1 method implementation
//m2 method implementation
