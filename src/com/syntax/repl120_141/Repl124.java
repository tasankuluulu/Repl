//Declare static variable in class level as below and assign its value:
//
//String ss="Welcome To Syntax Technologies"
//
//Access variable in the main method and print it using three ways you learned so far
//
//Hint:
//first way: By calling directly
//Second way: By using the className
//Third way: By creating the object of the class
//
//Expected Output:
//Welcome To Syntax Technologies
//Welcome To Syntax Technologies
//Welcome To Syntax Technologies
